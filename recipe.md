Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) standard or 320°F (160°C) fan/convection.
Lightly grease 2x 9-inch (22cm) round cake pans with butter. Line base with parchment paper.
Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Whisk in sugar, then add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free, about 30 seconds.
Pour boiling water into batter, mixing well. Cake batter is thin in consistency.
Pour batter into cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool
